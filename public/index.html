        <p>Yes, this is a pretty spare website - and that is totally by design. I love the <a href="https://leiningen.org/">leinigen</a> site, and wanted to build a super clean webapp dealing mostly with my development experience, and then some very random items that are totally unrelated.</p>

A few other places to see my work are at <a href="http://thisapp.digital">thisapp.digital</a> as well as this rather old-school <a href="https://tylerford.io/">bio</a>, which has links to many other projects, and (bonus!) a form that stores your message in firebase (as effective as training a homing pigeon) and a photo from when my hair was long.</p>

            <p>I know it sounds a little weird to be excited about something like that, but 2020 has been both terrifying and boring, and a little normalcy will go a long way even if it's really not that normal at all.</p>
