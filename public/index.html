        <p>Yes, this is a pretty spare website - and that is totally by design. I love the simplicity of the <a href="https://leiningen.org/">leinigen</a> site, and... imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but also if I can't stop myself from buying domains I may as well have like 40 personal web sites. So here's a 'bio', and then some very random thoughts.</p>

            <div class="justify">I'm a software engineer in salt lake city, currently working with <a href="https://medicine.utah.edu/ccts/bmic/">these amazing folks</a>. Other spots to see my work are <a href="http://thisapp.digital">thisapp.digital</a>, as well as this rather old-school <a href="https://tylerford.io/">bio</a>, which has links to many other projects, and (bonus!) a form that stores your message in firebase (as effective as training a homing pigeon) and a photo from when my hair was long.
            <p>The code for <em>this</em> site is <a href="https://github.com/tylermorrisford/teef-dot-dev">here</a>, but most of the interesting stuff is in the nginx configuration. Unless you get excited by an express server that sends one html file. But if you do, right on! let's hang out.</p></div>

            <div class="justify"><span id="hockey"></span> 
            <p>I know it sounds a little weird to be excited about something like that, but 2020 has been both terrifying and boring, and having something to look forward to could do wonders for mental health. Plus, you know, it's hockey!</p>
