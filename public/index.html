        <p>You might notice that this is a pretty spare website - that's by design! I love the <a href="https://leiningen.org/">leinigen</a> site, and wanted to build a webapp dealing mostly with my development experience, and then some very random items that are totally unrelated.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>I'm a software engineer in salt lake, currently working with <a href="https://medicine.utah.edu/ccts/bmic/">these amazing folks</a>.</p>
        <p>A few other places to see my work are at <a href="http://thisapp.digital">thisapp.digital</a> as well as this rather old-school <a href="https://tylerford.io/">bio</a>, which has links to many other projects, a form that stores your message in firebase (as effective as training a pigeon) and a photo from when my hair was long.</p>
        <p>The code for this site is <a href="https://github.com/tylermorrisford/teef-dot-dev">here</a>.</p>
