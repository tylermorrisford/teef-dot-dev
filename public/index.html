        <p>Yes, this is a pretty spare website - and that is totally by design. I love the simplicity of the <a href="https://leiningen.org/">leinigen</a> site, and... imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but also if I can't stop myself from buying domains I may as well have like 40 personal web sites. So here's a 'bio', and then some very random thoughts.</p>

            <div><h2>why</h2></div>
            <div class="justify">I'm a software engineer in salt lake city, currently working with <a href="https://medicine.utah.edu/ccts/bmic/">these amazing folks</a>. Other spots to see my work are <a href="http://thisapp.digital">thisapp.digital</a>, as well as this rather old-school <a href="https://tylerford.io/">bio</a>, which has links to many other projects, and (bonus!) a form that stores your message in firebase (as effective as training a homing pigeon) and a photo from when my hair was long.
            <p>The code for <em>this</em> site is <a href="https://github.com/tylermorrisford/teef-dot-dev">here</a>, but most of the interesting stuff is in the nginx configuration. Unless you get excited by an express server that sends one html file. But if you do, right on! let's hang out.</p></div>

            <div class="justify"><strong>'Public' Health</strong></span> 
            <p>Let's all wear masks, socially distance, wash the hands - all of it. If you're a healthy man and you can't do these simple things to help keep everyone safe, then you have very fragile manhood, and your logic resembles that of a 4 year old. 2020 has been really terrible for A LOT of people, so making one or two *tiny* sacrifices should be within everyone's ability. Maybe we can turn it around for next year! Let's hope.</p>
